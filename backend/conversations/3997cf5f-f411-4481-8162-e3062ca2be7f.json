The flags `has_cv: False` and `matching_intent: False` indicate that no CV was uploaded or parsed, and the user's query does not explicitly ask to match jobs with a CV.\n\nSince there is no CV to process and no job listings or specific job URLs provided in the query, I must inform you that there's insufficient information to proceed with CV-job matching or to present grounded job opportunities based on a CV.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for job opportunities, I can guide you on how to find them. You can provide a company name, a specific job title, or a URL of a job listing page or a company's careers page, and I can assist you in finding and summarizing job information accordingly.\n\nPlease let me know how I can assist you further in your job search. Would you like to:\n1. Search for jobs at a specific company?\n2. Look for a particular job title?\n3. Analyze a job listing page?\n\nYour input will help me provide you with more targeted and useful information.", "timestamp": "2025-08-21T16:47:56.332128"}, {"role": "user", "content": "search jobs from https://www.keejob.com/offres-emploi/", "timestamp": "2025-08-21T16:48:58.705905"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the provided context and the original query to search jobs from https://www.keejob.com/offres-emploi/, I must first acknowledge the constraints and requirements outlined:\n\n1. **No CV Provided**: Since `has_cv` is `False`, I will not attempt to perform CV-job matching.\n2. **No Matching Intent**: With `matching_intent` being `False`, the focus shifts to presenting available job opportunities without any claims of matching them to a specific CV.\n3. **URL Provided**: The user has given a specific URL to search for jobs, which is https://www.keejob.com/offres-emploi/.\n\n**Action Plan**:\n\n- **Precheck**: Validate the provided URL to ensure it's accessible and relevant for job searching.\n- **Crawling**: Given that this appears to be a job listing page, a comprehensive crawl might be necessary to extract all available job opportunities.\n- **Analysis**: Determine if the page contains a list of jobs or a single job posting and adjust the extraction process accordingly.\n- **Presentation**: Provide a summary of the job opportunities found, highlighting key details for each position, and include instructions on how to apply if available.\n\n**Execution**:\n\n1. **Precheck and Crawling**: Upon attempting to access https://www.keejob.com/offres-emploi/, it's crucial to respect any rate limits and ensure the URL is valid. Assuming the URL is valid and accessible, the next step involves crawling the page to identify if it contains a single job posting or multiple listings.\n\n2. **Analysis**: For the sake of this response and without actual crawling capabilities in this context, let's assume the page contains multiple job listings. Each listing would ideally include details such as position title, company, location, job type, key responsibilities, requirements, and benefits.\n\n3. **Presentation**: Given the hypothetical nature of this analysis and the lack of actual data extracted from the website, a precise presentation of job opportunities cannot be provided. However, the format for presenting job information would follow the guidelines outlined:\n\n    - **For Single Job Postings**:\n        - Position Title\n        - Company\n        - Location (if specified)\n        - Job Type (Full-time/Part-time/Contract)\n        - Key Responsibilities\n        - Requirements\n        - Benefits (if mentioned)\n        - Application Process\n\n    - **For Job Listings**:\n        - Summary/Counts of available positions\n        - Top Opportunities: Highlight 3-5 grounded positions with real URLs\n        - Detailed Breakdown: List each position with key details\n        - Application Instructions: How to apply for different positions (only if present on pages)\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nWithout the ability to crawl the website in real-time or access specific job details, the most accurate next step would be to suggest visiting the provided URL directly (https://www.keejob.com/offres-emploi/) and exploring the available job listings manually. This approach ensures that the user can access the most current and comprehensive list of job opportunities, adhering to the principles of efficiency, respect for website policies, and the provision of accurate, user-centered information.", "timestamp": "2025-08-21T16:49:10.953638"}], "file_path": null}
